Welcome to my iOS Quad Solver! Right now it’s a simple and free app and I’m putting all the code out there for everyone to view, however, please don’t copy it without asking me first. :) I haven’t fully decided on how I want to license the project, so until further notice everything is All Rights Reserved to me, Michael Ball.

However, please to play around with the code and build the app in Xcode or send me a message, or whatever you’d like! 

As far as code and organization goes:
Quad Solver is the main folder which has all the supporting material, including images and the xcodeproj file.
Quad Solver 2 is a pretty messed up project that was going to include iPad support. It needs work.
Quad Solver stuff has some older duplicates of the above as well as a few weeks of sales records before I started using n online service (and after I lost a couple years of records…)
